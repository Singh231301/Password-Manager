# Password-Manager

**Password Guard**  
Tired of remembering passwords and login credentials for countless websites and apps? Let Password Guard do it for you.

**Password Guard** is an app that securely stores all your login passwords and confidential data in an encrypted database. All you need to remember is one master passcode, which acts as the access key to the app. If your device supports fingerprint authentication, you don't need to remember anythingâ€”just use your fingerprint as the access key. Password Guard is 100% secure, utilizing highly secure 256-bit AES encryption technology to protect your saved data.

You can trust Password Guard because it has no internet access, ensuring that your data remains private.

### Key Features:

- **Simple Design and Easy to Use**: An intuitive interface that is user-friendly.
- **Unlimited Password Storage**: Store as many passwords or login credentials as you need.
- **Strong Data Encryption**: Your data is encrypted using 256-bit AES technology, the same algorithm used by banks to secure data.
- **No Internet Required**: The app operates entirely offline for maximum security.
- **Protected with a Master Password**: Your data is accessible only with a master passcode.
- **Fingerprint Unlock**: Use fingerprint authentication if your device supports it.
- **Import and Export CSV File**: Easily transfer your data to another device by exporting it in a non-encrypted CSV file, and then import it on the new device.
- **Auto Exit on Screen Off**: Enable this setting for extra security, causing the app to exit automatically when the screen is turned off.
- **Disable Screenshots**: Increase the security of your confidential data by disabling screenshots within the app.
- **Self-Destruct Feature**: If enabled, your data will automatically wipe after five incorrect passcode attempts.

**Important Notes**:
- If the master passcode is lost, the stored data cannot be recovered.
